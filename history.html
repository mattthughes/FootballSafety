            Football is the most popular sport in the world with that popularity
            football is never far away from its own controversy, whether that is
            the negilence of the authorities in charge of football, football
            hooliganism or the emergency authorities such as the police,
            football is never far away from a scathing headline, such as the
            Hillsborough disaster or the Bradford fire, We are focused on
            improving football safety and will not stop until football fans can
            freely enjoy a game of football, without fearing for their own
            safety. The Hillsborough disaster is one of the worst disasters in
            british football history and is the event we are highlighting, this
            controversy has not ended and is even continuing at the time of
            writing.

                Fans gather at Sheffield Wednesday's football ground amid a
                "carnival atmosphere". The mood is described as "boisterous" but
                jovial. As kick-off approaches, a large crowd builds up outside
                the Leppings Lane turnstiles. Following an urgent request to
                relieve the pressure, match commander Ch Supt David Duckenfield
                gives the order to open an exit gate. Two thousand Liverpool
                fans enter via a tunnel on to already-packed terraces. A severe
                crush develops in the central pens and people are pulled out in
                a "human cascade". Ninety-six men, women and children lose their
                lives with hundreds more injured. The oldest victim was 67, the
                youngest just 10 years old.

                As the disaster unfolds, Ch Supt Duckenfield tells key people
                that a gate was "forced" by Liverpool fans, a claim reinforced
                in briefings to media sources. The lie goes around the world, in
                TV and radio news bulletins. Newspapers take up the story
                pointing the finger at "drunk and ticketless" supporters. The
                Sun prints its now infamous front page alleging Liverpool fans
                had "urinated on police officers" and "picked the pockets of the
                dead".

                A judicial inquiry is held into the tragedy. Lord Justice
                Taylor's report concludes the failure to close off the tunnel
                was "a blunder of the first magnitude" and match commander David
                Duckenfield "failed to take effective control". His final report
                recommends a move to all-seater stadia, which leads to a ban on
                standing at football matches, eventually imposed on all clubs in
                the top two divisions in 1994.

                The original inquests into the deaths prove hugely
                controversial. Coroner Dr Stefan Popper rules out any evidence
                relating to fans' deaths beyond 3.15pm because, by this time, he
                said "the damage was done". This is "strongly disputed" by

                In a bid to hold someone criminally responsible for the deaths
                of the 96, the Hillsborough Families Support Group begins a
                private prosecution. David Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard
                Murray are charged with manslaughter and misconduct in public
                office. The jury acquits Mr Murray and, after they fail to reach
                a verdict on Mr Duckenfield, the judge imposes a "stay of
                prosecution" saying he should not face a retrial.

                the then Culture Secretary Andy Burnham demanding "justice for
                the 96". Their anger prompts the MP, an Everton fan from

                for any information held by public bodies on Hillsborough to be
                made released. A 140,000-signature petition forces a Commons

                All charges against Sir Norman Bettison, who was accused of
                trying to blame Liverpool fans for the disaster, are dropped
                because of insufficient evidence.

                he first Hillsborough trial begins at Preston Crown Court.
                Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross
                negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. Graham Mackrell
                denies two health and safety offences, one of which is later

                The jury fails to return a verdict on the manslaughter charge
                against Mr Duckenfield. Prosecutors say they will seek a
                retrial. Jurors did find Mackrell guilty by majority on a health
                and safety charge relating to the adequate provision of
                turnstiles on the day.
