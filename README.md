![Responsiveness logo](docs/wireframes/responsiveness-footballsafety.png)

## Project Introduction:

Football Safety is an online website designed to inform football fans of football disasters, showing the effects these have had on the people, how we cannot let the victims be forgotten. This website aims to improve safety at football by providing insight to football fans around the world, this will be done by using videos, text, images and a timeline on our history page, while also allowing users to submit there own experience by filling in our contact us form.

The inspiration behind this project came from researching about football disasters, how this effected the area whether it was the Bradford fire or the Hillsborough disaster, each event impacted the region and changed football forever.

## Design:

![Color palatte](docs/wireframes/colorpalette.png)
This is the color palatte I decided on, all the colours flow together and create an interesting and somber design which fits the theme.

## Typography

### Headings

I decided to go with the following style for headings I felt this really fit the proffessional design I was going for and didn't take any attention away from the content

![Heading font](docs/wireframes/heading-font.png)

### Body

I decided to go with the following style for all other text on the website, as I liked how professional the style looked and like the headings didn't take any attention away from the rest of the content on the website.

![Body font](docs/wireframes/google-font-body.png)

## Wirefames

This is how the project will look on a desktop device, as shown on the mobile version everything is highlighted with how the project is structured on a desktop device.

## Key Features:

### Favicon

![Favicon logo](docs/wireframes/footballsafetyfavicon.png)

- A favicon generated by using favicon.io
- This was set up in the head section and is visible on most browsers.
- This design was very simplistic, I liked how the text fit with the colours on the favicon, for the background color of the favicon this was the body background colour of the website and the font colour for the favicon was the font colour for all headings.

### Navigation Bar

- This feature is highighting the other pages on the website, with the Home, History, Gallery, Contact us page this is shown on the navigation bar with it collapsing on mobile devices and stretching on larger devices, on the mobile format there is a box shadow as well showing the other pages on the website.(See below for the mobile and desktop view)

## Accesibility

- Accesiblity was a major focus for the project, making sure colours didn't clash and fit well together.
- I used Coolors, Wave.webaim and the colour grid to find which colors wouked together and which ones did not.
- I also added alt image text for visually impaired users, incase the image itself did not load they would still be able to understand what image was meant to be there not ruining the overall flow of the website.
- The video element allows the user to completely control the video such as sound, pressing play and adjusting the screen size if they wish.
- The video also has a link below stating there is a link incase the video is not working, this link will open in a new tab not taking the user away from the website.
