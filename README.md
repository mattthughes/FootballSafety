## Accesibility

- Accesiblity was a major focus for the project, making sure colours didnt clash and fit well together.
- I used Coolors, Wave.webaim and the colour grid to find which colors wouked together and which ones did not.
- I also added alt image text for visually impaired users incase the image itself did not load they would still be able to understand what image was meant to be there not ruining the overall flow of the website.
- The video element allows completley control from the user, the video does not autoplay and is muted to start with the user can control this.
- The video also has a link below stating there is a link incase the video is not working this link will open in a new tab not taking the user away from the website.

# Testing

### Solved Bugs

- Had an issue where the navigation bar wasnt being centered on desktop devices I changed the padding left value to 6px to fix this issue.
- Fixed a bug where the about us and football safety section were not stacking appropriately on tablet screen sizes.
- Fixed a bug where the contact page was not displaying webpage elements correctly such as footer titles all being in the wrong pace, to fix this I adjusted the html to improve the formating
- Fixed a bug where the timeline wasnt stacking correctly adjusted the height of the timeline dimensions to fit the issue
- Another Issue occured where the timeline content was not showing correctly deleted the height property in the timeline class to fix the issue and increased the padding top value to seperate the containers correctly.
- Fixed formatting issue for timeline ran into an issue where the timeline wasnt adjusting because of the screen size, to fix this I changed the formatting for the mobile device using flex box to make it easier to style the timeline for larger screen sizes.
- Fixed formatting for timeline on laptops and larger devices to fix this I changed the properties of the timeline container, for the circles and for the vertical timeline bar.
- Fixed the video pathway issue by adding in a dot before the forward slash to correctly show the video element on git hub
- Fixed an issue where the hover element was showing twice and was much bigger than the social media icon to fix this I changed the width and height to fit the content.
- Fixed an issue where the nav bar wasnt displaying correctly the contact us part of the nav bar was going onto the next line to fix this I changed the padding left value to 0
- Fixed a CSS error that stated top could not be just 100 added the unit to 0 to fix this issue.
- Fixed an issue with contact page where the sign up form radio buttons were not even to fix this I added different divs for the radio buttons to fix the spacing between the elements
- Fixed error message for form changed the method from POST to GET to fix this.
- Fixed issue regarding hover effect the effect would be visible after clicking on mobile changing to a media query to only show up when hovered on laptops and desktops
- Fixed an error with 404 page the git hub page was continuing to be shown to fix this I renamed the file to a 404.html and this fixed the issue
- Fixed styling errors regarding 404 page social icons weren't sticking to the bottom of the page increased margin and padding value to fix this.
- Fixed timeline error the timeline on tablets mobiles and desktop devices was working but when checking the responsiveness of the website the circles on the timeline were not staying consistent, The issue for this was the large padding left values with different media querys in order to fix this I adjusted these values and aligned the timeline containers to the center to make sure they were consistent and responsive to fix the circles I increased the left property to 97.5% and this fixed how the circles were aligned on the timeline for larger devices such as tablets and larger desktops. I also changed the width for both left and right containers for tablets to 50% and to 100% for the desktop devices.
- Fixed issue regarding contact page, thank you page, error page by adding a padding-top value for social media icons making sure the layout was staying consitent and was responsive on multiple screen sizes.
- Fixed button error by changing element to an anchor tag and removing the type attribute in order to follow better practices.

### Manual Testing 

#### Aims

* The aim is to make sure the website is responsive for all screen sizes without needing to rotate the screen.
* Making sure all elements are consistent and not overlapping or not on the screen in general.
* Each page and device size has the same style making sure font is consistent and isnt different from page to page. 
* All videos links and buttons work as intended
* Make sure error page is deployed by github rather than githubs own error page.
* When submitting form the form submission takes the user to a thank you page keeping the same design as the rest of the website 


#### Testing steps

* I will test the responsiveness for all screen sizes by firstly right clicking on the website and using the inspect tool which will open the google chrome deveopler tools
* Following this I click on the laptop in the developer tools and change the aspect ratio to 280px the lowest screen size and begin adjusting the screen size for all pages making sure all elements are displaying correctly on all screen sizes.
* I will be testing all elements such as links making sure they open in new tabs for social media icons and video links, buttons making sure they return to the right pages and there is no errors
* I will be making sure the video doesn't autoplay and is muted to start with to follow best practices.
* I will make sure github will be finding the error page I created for the website compared to the usual github error page that is usually displayed.
* Doing the above steps will make sure each element is responive and is working as intended.
